    <h1> MY IT PROFILE </h1>
    <h2> 1. Personal Information </h2>
    <p> My name: Trinh Quang Minh </p>
    <p> Student ID: 3848088 </p>
    <p> Email: s3848088@rmit.edu.vn </p>
    <p> I am 19 years old, living in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. I've learnt a little bit about coding in Python. My hobby is listening to music and I can play the piano, guitar. I also have spent 3 years studying high school in Sydney, Australia.</p>
    <p> At RMIT SGS, I'm currently a member of RMIT Mass Media Club, where I'm working in the Human Resource department.</p>

    <h2> 2. Interest in IT </h2>
    <p> I was interested in IT since 2017, it all starts when I chose ICT (Information Communication Technology) as one of my electives. I found out that this is subject interesting as I had the chance to learn about the IT world even though at that time it was just basic things from different areas of IT industry, and I want to know more about it. At that time, I like to spend my time sitting on my computer, so this is perfect for me to dive into IT. When I reach year 11, I choose Software Design as one of my main subjects and I've learnt about basic Python coding and I get 70% marks for the year 12 graduation exam. </p>
    <p>  I choose to come to RMIT as I like the environment in Viet Nam more than the overseas, so I headed back to Viet Nam for my university time period. And from this school that I pick, which is School of Science Technology (SST), I hope that I can improve my skill to a more advanced level than I am currently.	</p>
    <h2> 3. Ideal job </h2>
    <p> I found out that currently HARAVAN is a big company in Viet Nam, where they provide an extremely good websites for business’s purposes. At the moment, they currently have position available in QC Engineer, where it requires to develop or test thousands of SaaS products to help merchants improving their businesses. This position which I think is suitable with me because this allows me to work with various new products, as I like to know more and more new things. Also, I am a careful person who pays attention to details and patients, which are some of their requirements to work in that position. Besides that, there are some extra skills that this position requires that I don’t have yet, such as “Experience in API testing, performance testing, security testing, usability testing, etc.”, I hope that during my university period I can learn those skills throughoutly. </p>

    <h2> 4. Personal profile </h2>
    <p> This is my personality test results that I've done on 16personalities.com: </p>
    <img src='personalitytest.jpg' alt="MBTI Test Results">
    <p> These results to me are really accurate as it has mentioned and described correctly how I work individually and as a group. I can be honest, direct and responsible. I have a good memory system so that can help me to remmeber impoortant details once I've encountered it, that's another strong point of myself being a Logistician. </p>
    <p> But being a Logistician comes with some other weakness when I work in a team such as I can get really stubborn. Sometimes I can say things that can hurt someone that I didn't meant to do it at all, but I have my ways to prevent that to happen is that I will think a lot when I'm about to say something that could potentially hurt the person who will receive the message.
    <p> My learning style results: http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-results.shtml?event=results&A=7&V=7&T=6&N=Minh </p>
    <img src='learningstyle.jpg' alt='Learning Style Results'>
    <p> The results shows that I'm an Auditory/Visual learrner, that means I'm most effective in learning something is when I have heard and listened to the information myself directly and I can store the information the way it sounds, I can understand spoken theory better than written theory. Besides that, I could remember and understand information by sight.  I'm at my highest focus is when I combine music to a thing/task that I have to do, even though some might think that it is distracting. </p>
    <p> I also did another test about my creativity and this is the result: </p>
    <img src='creativestyle.jpg' alt='Creative Style Results'>
    <p> Being a thinker benefits me in the ability to find and create meaning to things that I don't understand yet. Besides that, I can bridge theory and practice together, applying different ideas in to life. But I could get stucked with theories, concepts and abstracts more than the practices of it.  According to the test, I need a person who can counterbalance your introspective and analytical nature as a teammate so that we can achieve the best results.</p>
    <h2> 5. Project Idea </h2>
    <p> My project idea that I have in minds is to create something that can be helpful in a person’s daily life. The idea is that to have an application to help the users to work out and remind him/her to be healthy in both physically and mentally. The application can also have extra factors like “Daily Luck of a Sign” built in to help the users have more fun using the app. Besides that, it can also have a “Day counting” function to keep the users keeping track of their streaks. </p>
    <p> Nowadays, as there is a widespread occurrence of a virus called Corona has been affecting a lot on many different age groups and different countries all over the world. In Viet Nam, this virus has recently reappeared in the Da Nang area and still going on to spread around (nearly twenty thousand travelers departed from Da Nang to Ha Noi, an apartment in Ho Chi Minh city had been locked down for safety purpose). I think that at this point of time, one of the highest needs for the people is having a great health and to stay fit. </p>
    <p> The application will have these main functions are storing the users’ height, weight, date of birth, methods of practices, training, eating regulations. The application will ask for the users’ height, weight, date of birth and ask them to select their training method, or training styles. Not only those, it could also have a reminding system to help the users to set a time for them to be in their practice time and improve their daily diet, etc. This stored information will be used in creating the methods for the users to calculated specifically on what they want to become after a specific time period. The app can have a cloud full of steps you can practice at home and pick out the right one for the users. Besides that, another function the app can come with is the “Star Sign Lucky”, this can be used by the users when they input their date of birth, the app can find out their Star Sign and gives users tips of the day from that Star Sign and the Sign’s luck for the day. When the selected dated of the training period arrived, it will ask the users again for their body’s information and ask them to rate the changes they have so that they can change the training method for the next change. Even though, the app can still give the users tips to help them improve better in the future, the default setting for the tips is one tips per day or the users can set it to 3 tips per week or however they want, could be no tips at all if they choose to turn of that tips sending function. One more helpful function for this program is that it can set a streak counting for users so they can track on their progress and it will remind the users when their streak is getting lost to pull them back on track.  </p>
    <p> For this project to be done, I could work on JAVA as a base language, I can set a place (a cloud storage) to store the users information that they submit in and to store different learning methods of trainings and diet style and the daily Sign information. For this application to work, a smartphone is the perfect condition for its’ best performance. </p>
